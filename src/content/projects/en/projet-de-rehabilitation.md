summary: "An abandoned plot of land near a university campus, no shops, no gathering places. Our team of four reimagined this space from the ground up: eco-friendly housing on stilts, a modular cultural hall, a local convenience store. We produced architectural plans at 1/100 and 1/500 scale, 3D models and two physical mockups, all designed around sustainable materials and natural light."
conclusion: |
  This project allowed us to explore the different stages of architectural design in a sustainable development context. By combining site analysis, modular design, and ecological urbanism, we were able to propose a viable solution for the rehabilitation of an abandoned urban zone. This work could constitute a solid foundation for setting up a real reconstruction and urban planning project.

## 1. Site Analysis and Architectural Constraints

Site analysis revealed almost flat terrain, a lack of biodiversity, and the absence of water points. The presence of mature trees led us to preserve as many as possible to promote a natural and sustainable setting.

To meet residents' needs, we integrated cultural and friendly spaces as well as a freely accessible football field. A natural space was also planned to offer a place for relaxation.

Finally, since each plot was buildable and without particular restrictions, we were able to design a flexible and optimized layout:

From all these constraints, we were able to set up a complete project that I will detail throughout this page:

## 2. Housing Design

The project proposes the construction of housing adapted to a sustainable environment and for short durations. We then chose to go with single-story housing blocks for several reasons including these:

-   Spacing between bars allows a view towards the water point and greenery
-   Single-story design avoids obstructing the view
-   Each housing unit can have its own garden

### a) Design

Homes follow a modular design that allows space optimization while remaining pleasing to the eye.

Indeed, we first decided to use as many natural materials as possible to stick to the idea of environmentally friendly housing. Furthermore, we deliberately chose roofs with a slope and construction partially on stilts to generate depth and contrast to stand out from surrounding buildings:

### b) Plans and Technical Diagrams

Buildings are designed according to current standards and integrate several elements:

-   High-performance thermal insulation
-   Use of bio-sourced materials
-   Construction partly on stilts and piles (not to invade natural space)
-   Orientation and windows to maximize natural light

## 3. Public and Cultural Spaces Design

In parallel with housing, our project plans the rehabilitation of public spaces to promote conviviality and social mixing. The layout relies on creating structures adapted to residents' needs, while valuing local initiatives.

### a) Cultural Hall

We integrated a **cultural hall with diverse functionality** to address several issues:

-   **Place of exchange and socialization**: The cultural hall allows organizing events, exhibitions, and workshops promoting social cohesion. The space is modular to adapt to different proposed activities
-   **Neighborhood revitalization**: By proposing an integrated refreshment area, this space becomes an attractive meeting point, conducive to exchanges and community life

### b) Convenience Store

As for the convenience store, it also responds to a real existing demand:

-   **Facilitated access to basic necessities**: The convenience store favors short circuits by prioritizing local producers, thus limiting carbon footprint and strengthening local economy
-   **Lack of shops:** The surroundings are part of the scientific city, which integrates no non-state commerce, thus leading to strong demand

## 4. Models

To better visualize the entire project, we produced physical models:
